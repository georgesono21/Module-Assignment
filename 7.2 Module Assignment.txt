Selected Module: Tkinter

The purpose of tkinter is to create a more interactive user environment through the use of a graphical user interface.
With a GUI, you are able to communicate with the program visually instead of just through a keyboard.

The elements I plan on writing about:
- Classes with tkinter
- Frame function
- Button function
- Pack function
- Color function
- Label function
- Entry function

I plan on making a calculator with a GUI
